<h2>Jodi B</h2>
<p> Hi Everyone, I am out on a limb in this course, it feels like a foreign language, or two.<br>
    I have beem moving from major to major to find what I am truly passionate about. This could be it! </p>
   <p> I am a grandmother and mother, living in downunder - New Zealand. <br>
    I am Australian born with English, Maori and Samoan blood. So kia ora!</p>
    <p>
    I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints most of my life.<br> 
    I am teaching Gospel Doctrine at the moment and am so excited about studying the Book of Mormon<br>
    with my fellow saints in Temple View, Hamilton. 
    <p>Remember what President Nelson said about the Book of Mormon? <p>
    “My dear brothers and sisters, I promise that as you prayerfully study<br>
    the Book of Mormon every day, you will make better decisions—every day. <br>
    I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, <br>
    and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life. <br>
    I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be <br>
    immunized against the evils of the day, even the gripping plague of pornography <br>
    and other mind-numbing addictions” <br>
    (“The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It?” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 62–63).
</p>
<p> I am excited to get to know all of you too. Good luck as we tackle this new language.
</p>
<p> My husband noticed the image I am sharing with you. He suggested it was a bit wild,<br>
    to which I replied that it definitely depicts who I am. I cut him out. </p>
